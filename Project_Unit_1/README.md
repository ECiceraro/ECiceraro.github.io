General Assembly Unit_1 Project: Avengers Quiz

===============================================

Application:

Avengers quiz

Description:

Answer a couple(should be a few) questions and find out which Marvel superhero you're most like.

Explanations of technologies used:

- The webpage pulls data from the marvel comic api.
- The JQuery library was used and linked in the head.
- I also used a proxy to pull the data from the marvel DB, https://cors-        anywhere.herokuapp.com/. This allowed me to get around the http vs https challenge of loading the data on the live git pages site.

Installation:

The application is browser based, so just navigate to https://eciceraro.github.io/Project_Unit_1/ and begin playing!

Roadmap:

The developer plans to return to this game and build it out further, adding more questions for one, but also additional functionality like search bar for searching your favorite heroes.
